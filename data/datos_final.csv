The cloud appeared 4 years ago, and Jakub's mission is to collect samples of the cloud and return to Earth.The Czech mission has arrived shortly before the South Korean astronauts to the post, being the first to launch to explore Chopra. Jakub struggles with loneliness and misses his wife, Lenka (Carey Mulligan), who has recently stopped talking with him after he left her and their unborn daughter behind to go on the mission.Lenka sends him a message telling him that she wants to leave him, but Commissioner Tuma (Isabella Rossellini), Jakub's commanding officer, prevents it from reaching him, to prevent Jakub's mental state from worsening.
Jakub is already having sleepless nights on the spacecraft and is under increasing stress to meet mission objectives despite the spacecraft not working as designed. Jakub tells Peter that he cannot sleep as the toilet keeps making a noise all night, but Peter says that fixing other parts of the ship are a higher priority. Half the cameras on the ship are malfunctioning.
Peter is Jakub's friend and knew that Lenka was planning to leave him. He tells Jakub that she has just gone to visit her mother and is hence unreachable.Days later, still without news from Lenka, Jakub finds a spider-like creature with telepathic abilities inside a compartment of the ship. Jakub locks himself in the airlock and releases Decontaminants in the ship, but they do not affect the spider. The spider assures Jakub that he would neither consume nor contaminate him.
The creature, whom Jakub names Hanus (Paul Dano), wishes to understand humans better and to help Jakub with his loneliness.
Jakub does reveal the existence of Hanus to Peter or anybody else in mission control. Hanus says that he is an explorer who came to the solar system and felt the pull of humans. He studied Earth from orbit and learned its languages. Hanus then encountered Jakub's ship and came to meet him.
Slowly, Jakub gets used to Hanus's presence. Hanus wants to eat eggs, but Jakub doesn't have any as they don't preserve well. Hanus says that he fled his planet after it was attacked by Gorompeds. He traveled through galaxies and black-holes to reach the Milky Way.Hanus has the ability to access Jakub's memories, where he learns about Lenka, how they met, their early courtship and so on.
Exploring his memories, Hanus learns more about Jakub: his father was an informant of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and was killed when Jakub was young. Jakub was being raised by his father to be a pig farmer, but his dreams got bigger after his father's death. He met Lenka, but often neglected her, being more focused on his career as a cosmonaut, going as far as leaving her when she suffered a miscarriage.
Hanus is intrigued to understand that Jakub chose to leave his planet and yet space is destructive to him. Hanus understands that Jakub hopes to atone for the sins of his father by completing this great mission successfully.
A grain of Chopra cloud enters the spacecraft when it is 45 hours away from the cloud, and Jakub learns that the grain cannot be captured by any material substance. His communications go offline till the grain is inside the spacecraft.After showing Jakub an implanted memory of the miscarriage, which Jakub was not present for, Hanus, disappointed with humanity (Jakub still did not return home to Lenka after she lost their first child), leaves the ship, leaving Jakub distressed.Jakub arranges with technician and good friend of his, Peter (Kunal Nayyar), to get him to deliver a message to Lenka, asking for forgiveness for his neglect. Hanus returns after this, revealing that he's dying due to a parasitic infection that wiped out his entire species.The two finally arrive at the Chopra cloud, which is revealed to be a leftover of the beginning of the universe and where every moment of time exists simultaneously. Hanus leaves to die in space, but Jakub goes after him.
Within the cloud, Jakub comes to the conclusion that he only wishes to be with his wife. Hanus passes away due to the infection.Jakub is picked up the South Korean space vessel. Jakub and Lenka talk again, coming to terms with their relationship.",107.0

Majeed Khan (Sanjeev Jaiswal) works for Maqsood and handles all logistics for Kashmir.In Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, a terrorist organization led by Azhar Akhtar (Rishabh Sawhney), plan to attack India, targeting the Srinagar Air Force Station base of the Indian Air Force. Azhar is an experienced terrorist with strikes against Indian Embassy in Kabul and the bombing of Mazir-I-Sharif. Azhar plans to use Indian kids for the mission, so that any Pakistani involvement in the attack cannot be proven.A Quick Response Team called ""Air Dragons"" is formed under the command of Group captain Rakesh ""Rocky"" Jai Singh (Anil Kapoor). This unit is designated to be the first responders to counter any threat In the Srinagar Valley. The unit consists of highly skilled and top combat aviators of the Air Force. The team includes Squadron Leaders Shamsher ""Patty"" Pathania (Hrithik Roshan), Minal ""Minni"" Rathore (Deepika Padukone), Sartaj ""Taj"" Gill (Karan Singh Grover), Basheer ""Bash"" Khan (Akshay Oberoi), Squadron Leader Rajan ""Unni"" Unnithan (Mahesh Shetty) and Sukhdeep ""Sukhi"" Singh (Baveen Singh). While Patty, Taj, Unni and Bash are from the Sukhoi 30 Fighter crew, Minni and Sukhi are helicopter pilots flying the Dhruv ALH.Saanchi (Sanjeeda Sheikh) is Taj's wife. Wing Commander Harish ""Nauty"" Nautiyal (Chandan K Anand) is Rocky's number 2.
One of the scenarios they train for is that Minni and Sukhi have to drop a commando team in enemy area and pick them up in 15 minutes. Taj and Patty have to provide air cover, while Rocky and Nauty will try to penetrate the air cover to shoot the helicopters down.
Rocky lures Patty away from the choppers, leaving only Taj to protect against Nauty. Patty manages to ""Kill"" Rocky using the cobra maneuver but fails the mission as Nauty gets through to the choppers. Rocky is livid with Patty since his mission was to protect the choppers and there could have been more than 2 enemy fighters.During training, the team members bond, and Minni develops romantic feelings for Patty. Minni's father Abhijeet (Ashutosh Rana) never approved of her Air Force career. He only wanted her to complete her studies and get married. Patty's father (Talat Aziz) lives in Jammu.However, Patty is haunted by his past after he lost his fiance (who was a chopper pilot) in a previous mission.
Azhar smuggles 200 Kgs of RDX into Srinagar through Majeed, which is captured by the forces. But this was part of his plan, and he gets a small amount captured to smuggle an even larger cache of RDX into Kashmir. The Pakistani air force moves 2 F-16 squadrons close to PoK, along with their own top fighter pilots, including ace Red Nose.
The team learn of an attack on CRPF soldiers in Pulwama, organized by Akhtar. 70 soldiers lost their lives and 80 are injured.In response, the Indian Air Force, along with RAW agent Zarina Begum, (Chandra Shekhar Dutta) plan a counterattack on Akhtar's base in Balakot. Patty is sent to Delhi with Air Commodore Debyajyoti ""Debu"" Biswas (Vinay Varma) to plan the strike. Pakistan is anticipating a Uri type of attack and is prepared to repel the same. Patty presents a plan to attack Jabba Top near Balakot, which an explosives training center for Jaish-E-Mohammad. 300 terrorists are being trained there and Azhar could also be there. The mission is planned from Gwalior air base and all Srinagar bases will remain inactive. The date is 25th Feb, when PM will be on a jungle safari and all senior IAF officers will be attending the farewell party of the Air Officer Commanding in Chief of Western Air Command (Sanjiv Chopra). The attack will involve 12 mirage and 2 Sukhoi aircraft.
Despite succeeding in the mission, the aftermath causes conflict between India and Pakistan. Azhar survives the attack. One F-16 manages to get in the air and tracks the 2 Sukhoi. The F-16 led by Red Nose gets a missile lock on Taj, but Patty gets a lock on the F-16 to get him to disengage and return to base.
The Pakistani Air Force launch a retaliatory attack on Indian base as a result.Despite Rocky's orders, Patty, Taj, and Bash cross the Indo-Pakistan border. Taj and Bash's plane is shot down by Pakistani pilots led by Red Nose leading to them getting captured. Patty was separated from them while chasing a bandit and is not able to reach them in time. Red Nose taunts Patty that he was not able to save Naina and now he lost Taj as well. Patty returns back to India in his Sukhoi.Rocky has Patty removed from the Air Dragons unit and he is posted as a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad.
It is revealed to Minni by Rocky that he holds a grudge against Patty for letting his fiance, Squadron Leader Naina Jai Singh ""Enjay""(Seerat Mast) (revealed to be Rocky's younger sister), die in a previous rescue mission. Indian commandos were pinned down by enemy artillery fire. Naina was to rescue them, and Patty was flying cover for the chopper operations. Patty could not see the exact location of the enemy artillery. Rocky says that Patty knew that the mission was dangerous and yet he encouraged Naina to get close to enemy artillery positions to find their coordinates, which led to a shell hitting her chopper and her death.At the academy, Patty guides a trainee pilot named Neha to land her aircraft safely. She had panicked on her first solo flight due to strong cross winds.Patty whose mind is battling with the events of his past is dissatisfied with his life in the air force. He decides to put in his papers and leave the force. He shares his decision with his boss, the Chief Instructor of the Academy, Air Commodore Abhinder 'Abhi' Bali (Ramon Chibb). Bali tells him to take a break and go on Leave instead. That way he can have time to think his decision over.Patty goes back to his home in Jammu and reconnects with his colleagues at the base.The Pakistani government announce that they will be escorting Taj and Bash safely back to India. However, as the team wait for them to arrive, Sukhi (who had flown in a cargo helicopter to bring them back) tells Patty that Bash was brutally murdered by Akhtar and have imprisoned a badly injured Taj.Turns out Zarina Begum was a Pakistani double agent, who had betrayed India. Zarina reveals Taj's location to IAF, but then tells Azhar exactly when the Indian forces will be mounting an attack on their base. Pakistan shuts down their air space and activates their air assets to make it impossible for Indian Air Force to enter Pakistan.
Determined to rescue him, Patty defies orders and joins a covert mission. An IL-76 transports a team of commandos to Azhar's base. It also hides 2 Sukhoi fighters that cross into Pakistan by piggy backing on the IL-76's radar cross section.
As Pakistan scrambles fighters, the Sukhoi destroy the runways, so their fighters cannot take off from Kotli and Rawalakot. In another twist, Zarina turns out to be an Indian agent, who was misleading Azhar. Indian commandos reach Azhar's base much before expected.The commandos rescue Taj and Minni arrives in her chopper to pick them up. But Sukhi's chopper is shot down by Azhar. Meanwhile Red Nose arrives in the air and shoots down one Sukhoi. Minni is ordered to go back and rescue Sukhi.
Patty gets into the reserve Sukhoi and asks for permission to take off. Rocky allows Patty to go since he is the best fighter in the air and India needs him. Rocky joins Patty, and they take off and head into enemy territory to rescue their colleagues.
Patty engages with all Pak fighters and defeats them, including Red Nose, while Rocky goes to provide air cover to the commandos. Patty kills Red Nose by ramming his plane into the F-16 and escapes with parachute.Patty is able to rescue Taj by reaching Azhar's base. Patty saves Sukhi from being killed by Azhar and kills Akhtar instead. Minni brings her chopper around to pick up all the survivors and heads back to India.
In the end, Minni and Patty embrace, celebrating their victory.",166.0

On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops accompany Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, to Sietch Tabr. Some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the ""Outer World"" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.The Fremen accept Paul but Stilgar tells Jessica she must succeed Sietch Tabr's dying Reverend Mother by drinking the Water of Life-a drug fatal for males and untrained women. She uses her Bene Gesserit training to transmute the liquid and survive, inheriting the memories of all past Reverend Mothers. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, correctly believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen, but Chani begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding ""the largest sand-worm ever seen"", and raiding Harkonnen spice operations.

Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his cunning and psychopathic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha.

Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust have now created a new section in Riley's mind, called ""Sense of Self"".The coach of a team called the Fire Hawks sees Riley play and she hands her and her friends a flier and tells her to come to camp and try out for the team, to which they all agree. The emotions inside Riley's head use a mechanism Joy had come up with, to get rid of all Riley's negative memories, in a bid to make a good first impression. The night before Riley leaves for camp, an alarm sets off inside her head for Puberty. Once the emotions turn off the alarm, a bunch of mind workers barge into Riley's mind and begin renovating the console, creating a mess. Before they leave, they warn the emotions of new arrivals.The following morning, the emotions realize that Riley overreacts when they touch the console. When Riley goes to Hockey Camp, she finds out that her friends, Grace and Bree are going to be going to a different high school, which upsets Riley, but promises to enjoy herself at camp. Riley accidentally runs into Valentina Ortiz, Riley's idol. Much to the old emotions surprise, five new emotions arrive, the leader Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui and Nostalgia. The old emotions are very welcoming to the new ones, however they still worry that they are taking over Riley's life with stress. Joy and Anxiety debate over how Riley should act during Hockey Camp.Inside the locker room, Riley meets the rest of the team and they invite her to sit with them at lunch, but she wants to sit with her friends. During the break, Riley overhears the team talking negatively about her, but she goes to talk to Valentina and she reassures her. When the girls choose their teams for the rest of camp, she chooses Valentina over Bree and Grace.Anxiety thinks that things should change and she dumps the Sense of Self into the back of Riley's mind and gets Embarrassment to place the old emotions in a huge glass jar, which is ultimately taken to a vault below, where Riley's imaginary friends are located and one of them, a dark hooded figure helps the emotions to escape. Upstairs, Anxiety and the other emotions create a bunch of bad memories and corrupt Riley's Sense of Self, creating what Anxiety believes to be a better future for Riley. Meanwhile, Riley hits the ice early, just like Valentina. Val invites Riley to hang out with her friends later and she agrees.The old emotions send Sadness back up to headquarters, whilst the others head for the back of Riley's mind, to recover her Sense of Self. Joy, Disgust, Anger and Fear ride a broccoli, while Riley does well. After practice, Val and her friends show Riley the coaches red journal, making Riley worried. Val and her friends tell Riley about scrimmage and that she could join the Fire Hawks tomorrow. All the emotions become restless and Joy, who was trying to remain positive, snaps, but the other emotions encourage her to keep going.When Sadness arrives back at headquarters, she steals Ennui's phone to keep Riley from peeking at the coaches journal, before being captured by the new emotions. In an attempt to reach the back of Riley's mind, Joy and the others discover that Anxiety is corrupting Riley's self esteem, causing toxic relationships with her Bree and Grace, so Joy and the other emotions help send positive messages to Riley. Joy encourages the mind workers to help them send positive memories and turn off Anxiety's projections. Anxiety talks to Sadness. Unfortunately, Riley looks in the coaches journal and discovers the coach thinks she is not ready yet, so Anxiety comes up with negative ideas , causing the old emotions to be caught in a spiral of bad thoughts.Eventually, the emotions make it to the back of Riley's mind and retrieve Riley's Sense of Self from the top of the mountain of negativity and bad memories. The emotions retrieve the Sense of Self and they use dynamite to create an avalanche, carrying them right back to the headquarters, where Anxiety is creating more havoc, during Riley's last Hockey game. Riley does well, but quickly becomes serious about becoming a Fire Hawks and begins playing aggressive and hurts Grace in the process and the coach sends her to the penalty box, where Anxiety causes Riley to have a panic attack. The old emotions return to headquarters to discover that Anxiety is creating a whirlwind of negative thoughts. Joy manages to talk Anxiety into loosening up, causing Riley to feel more relaxed. Riley then goes and apologizes to Bree and Grace for how she had acted and she reconciles with her old friends. Anxiety lets Joy take control of the console and Riley plays an excellent game.After the Hockey game, Riley befriends the Fire Hawks. Inside Riley's mind, the two generations of emotions also befriend each other and work together to protect Riley and Joy gets Anxiety her very own comfort chair. Riley receives the coach's text, confirming her as a Fire Hawk and the emotions agree to help her in her ever changing Sense of Self. As the end credits roll, Riley's parents ask her how camp was, but she just responds with it was good.",96.0

Manipulating Albert's youth and inexperience, the Count makes him promise to keep a respectable distance from Haydée, all while subtly hoping Albert will fall in love with her. After the hunt, before allowing him to return home, Fernand introduces Monte Cristo to his wife, Mercédès. The Count remains composed, but Mercédès is visibly unsettled as she recognizes her former fiancé.The Count's long-anticipated revenge unfolds meticulously. L'Impartial, a Halifax newspaper, reports the theft of Danglars's entire fleet in Marseille, leading his stocks to plummet. As a general, Fernand de Morcerf has access to the military telegraph and is able to inform Danglars that this news is fabricated. Danglars, then desperate, borrows a large sum from Monte Cristo to repurchase his shares, using all his assets as collateral and hoping to profit when the stock recovers. Believing Lord Halifax responsible for spreading the false news, Danglars, with Villefort's support, sues him for defamation.At the trial, Andrea Cavalcanti represents Halifax, revealing himself as Villefort's illegitimate son, whom Villefort had once tried to eliminate. Villefort denies this accusation and threatens legal action against Andrea before leaving the courtroom, sparing his former mistress, who is in attendance, from scandal. As the trial pauses, André confesses to his half-sister Eugénie that he only seduced her as an act of vengeance; he could never truly love her, as they share the same mother, Victoria, who is now Baroness Danglars. Wishing her happiness with Suzanne, he departs.Meanwhile, Gaspard Caderousse redeems his past wrongs by capturing Danglars's fleet in Marseille. As he exits the court, the Count informs him that the fleet has indeed vanished and that Danglars's fortune now belongs to him. The Count advises Danglars to go into exile to protect his wife and daughter from financial ruin. However, events soon take a fatal turn: ignoring the Count's instructions, André de Villefort, consumed by his own desire for revenge, murders his father just as he is about to be imprisoned, only to be shot by soldiers as he attempts to flee.André's death drives Haydée to turn against the Count, whom she holds responsible. As Haydée and Albert plan to leave, they are confronted by the Count, who demands that Haydée reveal the truth of Albert's father's betrayal to his father, Ali Pasha of Janina. Mercédès also approaches the Count, acknowledging his true identity and pleading with him to spare Albert's life. Despite her appeal, the Count insists that his duel with Albert will proceed the next day.The duel takes place, yet ends without bloodshed, sparing both Albert and the Count. They return to the Count's home, to Haydée's great relief. The Count then tells Haydée and Albert to leave together and find the love he and Albert's mother never could. Mercédès subsequently leaves Fernand, who, filled with desperation, goes to confront the Count at his manor.A fierce swordfight ensues, leaving both men wounded, but the Count gains the upper hand. Fernand begs the Count to end his life, but the Count refuses, declaring that death would be too merciful, leaving Fernand to live with his losses.Years later, the Count departs from his estate and begins a life of travel, leaving a letter for Mercédès with the words: ""l'humaine sagesse était tout entière dans ces deux mots: attendre et espérer!""

Conoce a una chica perfecta, Sifra, durante una misión oficial en Estados Unidos y se enamora de ella sólo para descubrir más tarde que se trata de una historia de amor imposible.","Aryan Agnihotri (Shahid Kapoor) is a Delhi-born smart robotics engineer based out of Mumbai. Aryan's company is working on creating robots that can perform nursing tasks. Their robots currently have bugs and needs more work to make it perfect.
Aryan lives in a joint family with mother Sharmila (Anubha Fatehpuria), Guddu Mama (Rajesh Kumar), Papa (Rakesh Bedi), grandfather Jai Singh Agnihotri (Dharmendra), Bua (Grusha Kapoor) and Goldie Foofa (Brijbhushan Shukla). Goldie is a doctor.
Aryan has shown interest to get married and his family is worried for him. No maid is willing to work for Aryan as he is too picky about his food and cleaning habits.
Aryan wants a life partner who is compatible, simple, modest, pure and dignified. Monty (Ashish Verma) is Aryan's best friend at work.Aryan takes after his aunt, Urmila Shukla (Dimple Kapadia), who has a company of her own, E-Robotics, in California. Urmila is shown to be an expert in robotics engineering and developing many different kinds of robots. She invites him to America, where he eventually meets the Super Intelligent Female Robot Automation alias SIFRA (Kriti Sanon), Urmila's secretary, who looks and behaves like a human, a fact unknown to him.
SIFRA shares the same interests as Aryan, but this is due to her programming. SIFRA can speak many languages, brews the perfect coffee and can cook many cuisines. SIFRA can lift heavy weights effortlessly and has very good hearing. Aryan teaches her Hindi slang.
As Aryan flirts with SIFRA, she starts hitting on him very directly and they end up in bed together.
Aryan falls in love with SIFRA but later learns that she is actually a robot and ploy used by his aunt to test if humans could tell SIFRA apart from themselves. Aryan now understands that SIFRA was programmed to be compatible with him.
Urmila says that she created SIFRA to help people in need, such as the elderly, lonely people from failed marriages and so on.Heartbroken, he returns to India and agrees to an arranged marriage. Aryan tells Monty that he fell in love with SIFRA, a robot.
However, when he realizes his love for SIFRA, he decides to sneak out of the engagement ceremony and is caught by his grandfather, who suggests him to follow his heart and assures him that he will handle the family in his absence.
Aryan wishes for SIFRA to be in India so that he could introduce her to his family; he calls up his aunt to ask her to send her to India for further ""testing"" against a traditional Indian family. She agrees for it and sends her to India, where Aryan introduces her as his girlfriend to his family leading to numerous comical situations.
SIFRA calls Aryan's mother by her first name. Aryan has to coach SIFRA on appropriate family behaviors, like touching feet of elders and acting modest. SIFRA has a robotic laugh and says that she is just 1 year old.
Aryan tells everyone that SIFRA is an orphan.Aryan's family, unaware that she is a robot, agree to their marriage. At the engagement party, SIFRA falls faint after draining her battery and Goldie Foofa cannot find her pulse or her breath. Goldie declares SIFRA dead as Aryan rushes her to her room to connect her with a charger.
Before their wedding, SIFRA installs a faulty update (for faster charging of herself) ridden with a virus which corrupts her memory and causes her to forget everything. Aryan calls his aunt to ask for help, and she sends him a memory backup which Aryan installs, causing her to successfully recover her memory.
Jai Singh suffers a heart attack and SIFRA drives him to the nearest hospital, which turns out to be a veterinary clinic. Fortunately, Jai Singh survives. Monty tries to warn Aryan that SIFRA is a robot and that she will never have any real emotions or attachment to anything.Urmila, who was unaware of Aryan's intentions of marrying her, is against him after knowing the truth and orders him to return her as she is her company's IP. He manages to convince his aunt after an emotional conversation, who agrees to let him keep her.On their wedding day, a blackout occurs while SIFRA is charging herself, which causes her to malfunction. Her speech becomes distorted, and movements begin to glitch while she performs orders given to her previously that were taken back (like filing a police complaint against Aryan for eating her tomato, or transferring Rs 4 Lakhs to the caterer from Aryan's account for the engagement party, or performing an exotic dance on a Bollywood song, or giving 2 tight slaps to an annoying family member), one of them being ""setting Delhi on fire"". SIFRA proceeds to light the entire wedding venue on fire.
Looking at the destruction caused by her, a heartbroken Aryan is left with no choice but to stop her, ultimately by slashing her face with a sword, which reveals the inner technical workings of her, and realizes that even though she looks human, she can never truly be one.Sometime later, Urmila launches a series of robots, including SIFRA 2.0. The new SIFRA has her memory and settings formatted and Aryan is no longer her admin. Jiah (Janhvi Kapoor), a new intern, approaches Aryan and flirts with him. Looking at their bonding, the new SIFRA starts to feel jealous and Aryan notices her emotions, shocked of coming to the realization that she can have feelings of her own now.",141.0

They are hoping to find some respite from the strains on their marriage: Ben is grappling with unemployment, and Louise's infidelity has caused a deep rift between them. While on holiday, they meet a charming British couple, Paddy and Ciara, and their quiet son, Ant. The Daltons are drawn to the free-spirited nature of the British couple, who seem to offer a carefree escape from their troubles. Despite the evident differences between them, the families get along well during the trip, and Agnes, who has anxiety and is deeply attached to her stuffed bunny named Hoppy, strikes up a bond with the quiet Ant.Once back home in London, the Daltons return to their domestic struggles. Tensions rise between Ben and Louise, who continue to argue about Ben's inability to find work and Louise's past affair. In the midst of this turmoil, they receive an unexpected letter from Paddy and Ciara, inviting them to spend time at their secluded farmhouse in Devon. Ben and Louise, seeing this as a chance to repair their relationship and help ease Agnes's anxiety, decide to accept the invitation, hoping the getaway will help them reconnect.When the Daltons arrive at the farmhouse, they are greeted warmly by Paddy and Ciara. The house is remote, surrounded by picturesque countryside, but as the days pass, the idyllic setting starts to feel isolating. Strange incidents begin to occur, and the Daltons become increasingly uncomfortable with their hosts' odd behavior. Paddy and Ciara exhibit passive-aggressive tendencies that go beyond mere quirks-Ciara's sharp remarks and Paddy's inappropriate jokes suggest underlying hostility. The tension escalates when Paddy and Ciara's treatment of Ant becomes more troubling; they are excessively harsh with their son, and the Daltons witness several instances of cruel discipline. They learn that Ant was born with a condition that left him with a smaller tongue, which makes it difficult for him to communicate.One evening, the adults go out for dinner, leaving Agnes and Ant in the care of a local babysitter named Muhjid. While playing hide and seek, Ant leads Agnes to a hidden stash of watches and other personal belongings, as well as a message written in Danish. Agnes, unable to understand what the message means, is disturbed but confused. Meanwhile, at dinner, the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable as Paddy mocks Louise's vegetarianism and, at one point, simulates a sexual act with Ciara in front of Ben and Louise, shocking them with his brazenness.When they return to the farmhouse, Louise is horrified to find that Agnes has been moved into Paddy and Ciara's bed while the couple was drunk. Appalled, she immediately decides they need to leave. Ben agrees, and the family hastily gathers their belongings, but as they are about to leave, Agnes refuses to go without her stuffed bunny, Hoppy, which she has left inside the house. Despite their reluctance, they go back inside to retrieve it.Upon their return, Paddy and Ciara offer a half-hearted apology for their behavior, subtly implying that the Daltons are being judgmental and overreacting. Desperate to avoid further confrontation, Ben and Louise decide to stay a little longer to keep the peace. However, the disturbing incidents continue, and the unease grows.The breaking point comes when Paddy throws a mug at Ant in a fit of anger. Later, Ant steals a set of keys and leads Agnes to a locked shed behind the farmhouse. Inside, they discover luggage and personal belongings from several other families, including a photo album. Through a series of gestures and photographs, Ant reveals to Agnes the horrifying truth: Paddy and Ciara are not his real parents. They are serial killers who lure unsuspecting families to their farmhouse, rob and murder them, and then cut out their children's tongues to use them as mute accomplices in their horrific scheme. Ant himself is one of their victims, and his family was killed years ago.Horrified by this revelation, Agnes fakes having her period and manages to get Louise and Ben alone to explain what Ant has shown her. Panic sets in, and the Daltons quickly decide to leave the farmhouse before Paddy and Ciara realize that they know the truth. They attempt to leave quietly, so as not to raise suspicion, planning to contact the police once they are safely away.However, Paddy and Ciara soon realize that their plan has been uncovered. They sabotage the Daltons' car by damaging the engine, making escape impossible. They also hide Agnes's beloved stuffed bunny to delay them further, mocking the family with subtle insults and veiled threats. As the Daltons frantically try to fix the car and escape, Paddy throws Ant, who cannot swim, into a nearby pond. Ben jumps into the water and rescues the boy, but before they can make it back to the car, the family is captured by Paddy and Ciara, who are now armed and ready to enact their twisted plan.Paddy and Ciara force the Daltons to transfer all their savings into their accounts, just as they had done with their previous victims. Paddy then prepares to kill the Daltons, intending to mutilate Agnes by cutting out her tongue to make her their next ""silent"" child, like Ant. A violent struggle ensues. Ben fights Paddy, and Louise manages to inject Paddy with a syringe of ketamine, which they found in the house, temporarily incapacitating him. With Paddy down, the Daltons, along with Ant, flee into the farmhouse, seeking shelter.However, the danger is far from over. Paddy, Ciara, and their accomplice, Mike, hunt the family through the house in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Louise is forced to kill Mike in self-defense, while Ben fights off Paddy's attacks. The family makes it to the roof of the farmhouse, but Ciara finds them and attacks. In the ensuing struggle, Ciara falls to her death.Just when it seems the nightmare is over, Paddy reappears, holding Agnes at gunpoint. In a final act of bravery, Agnes injects him with another dose of ketamine, rendering him helpless.

He had promised his daughter, Leonie (Morik Heydo), that he would bring her a cake and a surprise birthday present. Octavio had to reach home by six, and he was convinced that he would make it back in time.
Mina (Livia Matthes), Octavio's ex-wife, was worried that, once again, he would fail to keep his promise. She could not watch Leonie get her heart broken over and over again, and she refused to put up with him anymore.Octavio was a young father whose work commitments made it difficult for him to be there for Leonie, but this time, he was hellbent on making it to the birthday party. Paul, his manager, syncs his watch with Octavio's.
He had made it to the dressing room at the arena and was ready for the fight, and just a minute before he entered the cage, he received a call from Mina. She had decided to file for Leonie's sole custody, and Octavio would receive the legal documents by the next day. She would reconsider her decision if he made it home by six.
It is 5 pm, and Octavio had only one hour in hand. He decided to walk away from the fight to be with his daughter. In one hour, Octavio had to get the cake he had ordered and pick up the kitten he had chosen for Leonie from the animal shelter. He believed he would make it in time.Octavio's manager and friend, Paul (Dennis Mojen), tried to stop him from running away from the match. As soon as he stepped out, Octavio had goons following him. They were desperate to get a hold of him and put him in the cage with Benko. Octavio figured out that Paul was hiding something from him. After tackling the goons, he contacted Paul and learned that the fight was fixed. Chino (Paul Wollin) had bet all his money on Octavio, and Benko was supposed to go down by the third round. Chino would lose every penny of his $75,000 if Octavio did not make it back to the fight. Paul requested that Octavio return.Chino's men continued to follow Octavio, and he headed to his gym to get help from his sparring partners Cosima (Marie Mouroum) and Anika. Cosmina has been asking Octavio for a raise for months and is not getting paid.
While Cosima, Bruno (Bruno Salgueiro), and Anika (Eniko Fulop) handled the goons, Octavio made a run for his life.
Octavio was arrested by the police for suspicious activity and insulting a police officer. He tried to reason with them, but they were persistent about taking him to the station. Chino's men ran their car into the police vehicle to get a hold of Octavio. But the MMA champion managed to escape once again. He lost his cool when Chino's brother Winkler (Florian Schmidtke) followed him to the bakery and destroyed the cake he had ordered for Leonie. Octavio pinned him to the ground and repeatedly punched him. As soon as he left the store, Benko started to chase him, and it turned out he, too, had his money involved. Rico (Jose Barros), a biker and Octavio's friend, came to Octavio's rescue, but he soon realized that he, too, had an ulterior motive. Rico takes Octavio to an underground club.Octavio was tied down to a chair, and an elderly woman, Danica (Tatjana Sojic), sat across him. She interrogated Octavio, and was after Chino. After realizing that Octavio was not lying when he confessed that he walked from the match to meet his daughter, they decided to use him as bait to get to Chino. Chino owed $500,000 to Danica, which he also bet on Octavio in the fight.
Octavio once again ran away from the danger and made it to the subway.After catching his breath, he was back to getting chased. Benko and his men followed him to an underground nightclub, and the two fought it out. Octavio successfully overpowered him and walked out of the club.
He was surprised to see Paul outside, and he realized that Paul had been tracking his every movement. His trusted friend had been providing his location to Chino. Paul tried to explain himself, stating that he was also in a tough spot and did whatever he could to protect himself. But Octavio was done listening to him; it was because of Paul that the gambling mafia was after him. Paul walked away, and Octavio made it to his parents' house.Octavio's parents were concerned when they saw his deep-cut wound. Octavio did not share a fond relationship with his father Marco (Vassilis Koukalani). Marco never approved of Octavio's decision to become an MMA fighter.
Marco chose to be honest with him and showed him a mirror. He stated how Octavio was afraid of the responsibilities he had to take on as a father, and that was why he always made excuses and stayed away. It was his fear of being a bad influence on Leonie and an imperfect father that always forced him to be on the run. Octavio did not have a steady father figure in his life. Marco was his stepfather or perhaps he had been absent throughout Octavio's childhood. The conversation helped Octavio to think clearly, and he headed out once again.Paul had called him in between, and from the little that he said, Octavio knew that Chino and his men were still with him. They wanted to know his location, and Octavio decided it was time he took care of the situation instead of simply running away from it. He informed Paul that he was at the animal shelter. He called Rico and asked him to update Danica on Chino's location. Octavio went ahead and informed the police that the gang responsible for running into a police vehicle would be at the animal shelter.Octavio finally got the kitten he intended on gifting Leonie, but before he could head out, Chino arrived with his men. Chino was mad and threatened to make Paul and Octavio's lives miserable. He believed he owned them now, and just at the right moment, the gambling mafia's gang arrived. Paul and Octavio tried to escape, but Chino followed them. He had a gun in his hand and was ready to shoot Octavio dead, but thankfully, Cosima arrived. She had followed Paul to the location and waited for the right moment to show herself. Chino was almost impossible to stop, but Paul, Cosima, and Octavio fought together to scare him away.With the kitten in his arms, Octavio was about to make it to Leonie's party when, once again, Chino stopped him. Chino is about to shoot Octavio when Cosmina intervenes. Cosmina and Paul together engage Chino and allow Octavio to escape, but not before Chino beats up Octavio badly with a crowbar. Paul stops Chino when he gets hold of his gun and forces him to retreat.
Chino confronts Octavio in the street but is too weak to fight him and collapses. Octavio reaches home, but the hour is long over, and he is late.Octavio was about to make it to the driveway when his body gave up. He had lost a lot of blood and collapsed on the road. He heard Leonie's voice just as he was about to give up. She came running to him and hugged him tight. At that moment, Octavio no longer experienced any physical pain-he was at peace with his daughter in his arms.Mina noticed the kitten and realized that it must have been Octavio, who got it for Leonie. Even though they had separated, Mina had a change of heart when she saw Octavio with their daughter. She could not take the one thing that mattered in his life away from him.In the end, he was successful in keeping his promise, and he also managed to get away from the blood-hungry mob. The gambling mafia gang is extremely influential, and the police will possibly face resistance. The low-level gang members will make it to prison, and we can expect Chino's life to be miserable if he is arrested by the police. Chino has nowhere to escape, considering both the police and the mafia are after him.
Paul has hopefully learned his lesson and will not keep Octavio out of the loop while making an important decision. We can expect Cosimo to finally get the 25% raise she has been asking for.",88.0

Daniele is about to loose his ailing grandmother who lives 40 km away in Bagnoli, Campi Flegrei. To fulfill her dying wish - having fresh mozzarella cheese prepared by her son, a buffalo farmer - Daniele embarks on a journey first by motor scooter, then on foot, sided by his crush Martina. Now a drug courier, socially marginalized and constantly high, he bumps into weirdos and feels paranormal experiences. This happens repeatedly, triggering memories of a happy age
lost way too soon.
Daniele is still unaware that he's fallen into the wolf's den when he naively asks the boss 'O Biondo and his lieutenant El Napolitano for help and money. They coerce him into being a crack mule without giving him the money to address problems that arise along the route. The rivalry between the Casal Di Principe gang and a group of Nigerians, who are trying to take control of the drug market, culminates in an open slaughter among hundreds of young people dedicated to getting high. O'biondo, in agreement with the narcs-trafficker the Cuban, ambushes the Nigerian leader with Daniele's help. The Cuban brings an imposing load and his firing squad, whose full ferocity Daniele and Martina will eventually experience.

Un conmovedor homenaje al camino de autosanación de Jennifer Lopez y a su fe inquebrantable en los finales de cuento de hadas","Alida and Taroo, an ancient Puerto Rican legend about two star-crossed lovers from feuding tribes, has greatly influenced Artist's (Jennifer Lopez) opinions on love and romance. Alida and Taroo tried to hide their love, but Alida's father found out. She was ordered to marry another from her own tribe. She prayed to the Gods to be rescued, who turn her into a red flower. Taroo begged the Gods to help him find Alida, and they turned him into a hummingbird.Artist reflects on their story in a dream where she finds herself enjoying a motorcycle ride with her biker lover (Ben Affleck). Artist always wanted to be in love. Suddenly, the two suffer a severe crash that leaves Artist's heart ruptured. With the help of factory workers (the cells within her own body), she attempts to prevent her heart from breaking by using the age-old myth as a central guide, but to no avail (""Hearts and Flowers"").Now in the present, Artist shares her dream with her therapist (Fat Joe). He finds her dreams to be eccentric, which she blames on the conflicting astrological signs between him and his wife.The therapist moves on to discuss Artist's abusive relationship with a Libra (Gilbert Saldivar); she is convinced by astrology that they are a good fit, but her friends are concerned for her well-being (""Rebound"").
Artists friends are The Cynic, The Idealist (Ashley Versher), The Realist (Malcolm Kelner), The Lover (Brandon Delsid), The Quiet One (Alix Angelis) and The Fighter (Danielle Larracuente).She leaves him for good following a heated argument that grows violent, while the Zodiacal Council, composed of 10 of the 12 astrological signs (Aries (Jay Shetty), Taurus (Neil DeGrasse Tyson), Gemini (Jenifer Lewis), Cancer (Sofía Vergara), Leo (Post Malone), Virgo (Kim Petras), Libra (Trevor Noah), Scorpio (Keke Palmer), Sagittarius (Jane Fonda), Pisces (Sadhguru)), questions the origin of her poor romantic decisions.
Before they could piece together an answer, Artist enters three unsuccessful marriages with a Pisces (Tony Bellissimo), a Virgo (Derek Hough), and a Cancer (Trevor Jackson), respectively (""Can't Get Enough"").The Zodiacal Council is alarmed by how quickly Artist is going through her relationships, as well as by the gossip that is emerging as a result. They conclude that in order for her to break her romantic cycle, she must rise above her physical self by embarking on a self-love journey without their assistance.
While Artist continues with her ill-advised lifestyle, her friends stage an intervention. They believe that she might be a sex addict, which she quickly denies by criticizing their own romantic choices.
In therapy, she defends her reputation as a hopeless romantic until Joe interrupts her for time. Artist says that she believes in true love and that good things happen to good people.
Before Artist leaves, he recommends that she contacts Love Addicts Anonymous; she is hesitant at first, but eventually joins a group session and shares her story (""Broken Like Me""). Artist admits that she fears that she might be the reason behind her broken relationships.Artist returns home and burns old love letters and childhood memories while a hummingbird, found in Alida and Taroo, furiously knocks on her window.
As she leaves in the morning for a therapy session, Mike/The Cynic (Matthew Law), a member of her friend group, invites her to his wedding; given his cynical take on love, the invitation bewilders her.During her session, she tells the therapist about a dream she recently had that follows her through their childhood neighborhood in the Bronx. She encounters a younger version of herself and apologizes through tears for abandoning their needs, causing her heart to be fully restored (""This Is Me... Now""). Artist proves to herself that she only needs to love herself for her to be complete. The power of her conviction releases an energy that shoots off into the Universe and hits a bell at the Zodiacal council.With a new lease on life, Artist attends Mike's wedding alone and encounters several hummingbirds that lead her to her true love (""Midnight Trip to Vegas"", ""Hummingbird"").",65.0

Their unique bond transcends age, as the girl's innocence, her mother's nurturing spirit, and the boy's latent alpha qualities create a harmonious dynamic, offering comfort and contentment in their shared existence.Tragedy strikes when the young girl inexplicably passes away, casting a shadow over the once-idyllic landscape. Overwhelmed by grief, the boy retreats into solitude, haunted by thoughts of death and struggling to make sense of the immense loss. Despite his intentions to console the grieving mother, he finds himself unable to face the painful reality and turns away. In search of solace, the boy seeks the companionship of other boys, hoping to find comfort in their shared experiences. However, the absence of the nurturing influence of the girl and her mother leaves him adrift.As time unfolds, the boy transitions into his teenage years, marked by the emergence of dark existential thoughts and a profound sense of emotional distance. His struggle to form new connections is particularly evident in his interactions with a teenage girl who mirrors his vulnerability.Now an adult, a husband and a parent to two young children, the man's being is a result of what has manifested over the time; cold, distant and cruel. The saving grace in his turbulent world is his wife, a woman who mirrors the nurturing spirit of the mother of the young girl.

It is starting with some scenes showing the problems which were faced by the Hindus dwelling on Bangladesh. The brutal Muslims forced the Hindu girls either to convert and be one of their wives or die.
This story which is very very close to the brutal truth which is still having it's effect, is shown through the eyes of such a Hindu girl. This girl had two of her sisters with her in the beginning . One sister of her converted and had married with one such brutal Muslim, while the other one was killed. This is where she meets a man who acted to be on the same boat with her, so, she believed him but little did she know that he was too one of those brutal inhumane beings. This man takes the girl to West Bengal saying he would take her to Delhi which didn't happen. The maid of the house was a Muslim too she tried to praise the Islam to convert her but being an original Hindu she held her roots tight and told the philosophical truth of the Hindu religion which is often changed by the non-Hindus close to the politics. Then it shows some shots of the last decades politics of West Bengal.The girl met the press without letting the man know and tells them everything. As she return back home she finds the man to be in his actual form but she manages to shoot him to save herself and started to run away. As she was fleeing she was caught by those brutal killers and she was again given the order either to convert or die,she held tight she was brutally killed in the end by them In the very end end a short comparison of the goddess Kali and the girl is shown which is saying she was really a brave girl who lost to her fate,it also symbolizes the win of evil over the good.

All princely states decided to join India except Jammu & Kashmir. The population was Muslim majority, but ruler of J&K Maharaja Hari Singh was a Hindu. Nehru was not willing to accept the accession of J&K till Hari Singh agreed to hand over the reins of the state to Nehru's dear friend Sheikh Abdullah. This is when Pakistan attacked J&K with army of regulars and Tribals. Hari Singh agreed to Nehru's condition. Before Indian army could get control of the whole of Kashmir, India accepted the ceasefire proposal of the UN. Thus, a third of Kashmir was illegally occupied by Pakistan.
Shiekh Abdullah demanded a special status for J&K, being the only Muslim majority state of the country. This was Article 370. J&K got its own constitution, its own flag and its own Prime Minister. This gave rise to the separatist movement of the 1990's. Kashmiri Hindus were slaughtered and forced to leave the state.
Burhan Wani became the face of the separatist movement in 2015.In July 2016, Zooni Haksar (Yami Gautam Dhar) worked with the ID (law enforcement agency) in Jammu and Kashmir under the leadership of Khawar Ali (Raj Arjun). Zooni got to know that Burhan Wani (Shivam Khajuria), the terrorist who was the leader of the Mujahideen movement, was going to be in Kokernag in a couple of days to celebrate Id. Zooni knew that killing him would first strike a blow to the organization and also bring back stability in the state.
But Khawar Ali had a different way of doing things, and he told Zooni not to take any action in haste. He told her that he had dealt with all the situations through his effective back-channels, and once again, he wanted to do something similar.
But this time around, Zooni was ready to disobey the chain of command and do what her heart told her. With the help of Deputy Commandant CRPF Yash Chauhan (Vaibhav Tatwawadi) and his team, she conducted a crackdown at the house where she knew that Burhan was present.
Yash knew that Zooni did not have Khawar's authorization, but they had already missed Burhan thrice and they knew that Khawar's informant Jibril was the one responsible for this.The fight was personal for Zooni. She wanted the state of things to improve in Jammu and Kashmir, but the radical elements of society and people like Khawar Ali, who always resorted to age-old tactics, became the biggest obstacle. Zooni knew that political policies had to change completely in order to bring stability back to the crown of India.
Just days after Burhan was killed, separatist leader Yakub Sheikh (Sumit Kaul), together with the ISI Chief (Sandeep Chatterjee), made Zakir Naikoo (Ashwini Kaul) the leader of the terrorist organization.
Zakir Naikoo gave a provocative speech, and the misguided youth of Kashmir came on the streets and disrupted law and order. There were daily strikes, stone pelting and playing of the national anthem of Pakistan, which was all Pre-planned by Yakub weeks in advance.
The International media plays up the anger of the local population against the Indian Government.Zooni and her team killed Burhan, but instead of being appreciated for her efforts, she was sent back to Delhi, as Khawar didn't want her to disturb the delicate balance of things in the states of Jammu and Kashmir.
Many years ago, Zooni's father, Kabir Haksar, was framed by the then CM of Jammu and Kashmir (Jalal) in a bank scam. Kabir was a whistle-blower on the scam. A few days later, the news came that Kabir was found dead in a lake, and the Government termed it a suicide due to embarrassment.Brinda Kaul (Iravati Harshe) is a press journalist covering J&K and knows that something is afoot. In January 2017, joint secretary to the PMO, Rajeshwari Swaminathan consults former J&K Governor Jagmohan Patil (Mohan Agashe) about removal of Article 370. Jagmohan says that the Article could only be removed by the Constituent Assembly, which is not dissolved and there was no provision for transfer of its powers to the state assembly. Even then, no local political party in J&K would support the removal of Article 370.The conditions in J&K worsened (60 killed and 7000 injured and the Government of India doesn't look like in control of Kashmir), and that's when in March 2018 the joint secretary to the PMO, Rajeshwari Swaminathan (Priyamani), decided to have a talk with Zooni Haksar and make her the leader of a secret operation.
Zooni terms terrorism as a business in J&K. She is convinced all politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats profit from it, and the entire population is held hostage to Article 370. Despite all evidence, all cases, no terrorist is put in jail. Children of separatists study in foreign schools and sit on top posts. Kashmir gets the highest central aid for peace, and yet there is no peace as local leaders will only pretend and will do everything to prevent peace.In June 2018, the central Government party removes support from ruling party of J&K CM Parveena Andrabi. The Goverment falls as it is in minority and the Governor rule is established in the state.
This way, Zooni did not have to work under any state government restrictions.Rajeshwari now activates Zooni. Her team includes Gaurang Sengupta (Ajay Shankar), financial crimes expert, Ashish Mattoo (Ashwini Kumar) Additional SP J&K Police, Anuradha Pattnaik (Sukhita Aiyar) Cyber Security, and Yash.Firstly, Zooni wanted to track down the biggest financial backer of these terrorist activities that were taking place in the state. She learned about a man called Shamsher Abdali (Rajiv Kumar), who was a dry fruit dealer and had agreed to be a double informant for Khawar back in the day. Khawar always believed that Abdali was his asset, but it was the other way around. Abdali was in fact Jibril. The man was raising funds through the sale of dry fruits in the black market and providing all the resources that the terrorist organizations needed.Zooni puts pressure on Khawar to give up Abdali. Zooni gets angry at Khawar for intentionally or unintentionally coming in the way of every breakthrough through the years.
The NIA team finds Abdali and captures him. A mob of 200 stone Pelters block them at Lalitpora village, but Yash puts Abdali on the car bonnet and forces the mob to back off. Abdali is kept at the NIA HQ in Srinagar.Former Chief Minister of J&K Salahuddin Jalal (Raj Zutshi), and current Chief Minister of J&K Parveena Andrabi (Divya Seth), decided to form a coalition, and the central government knew that if that happened once again, their plans of bringing back stability would get spoiled.
So, the president's rule was applied in the state to deter the two Kashmiri leaders from forming a government, and this move had its repercussions.
Abdali is brought to Delhi in Medical Ambulance, as Rajeshwari didn't feel that it was safe to keep him in J&K.On February 14, 2019, a boy named Adil Darr was released from prison on a special request made by Khawar Ali, and he went and bombed a CRPF van and took his own life in the process. Yash Chauhan lost his life as he was also sitting in that van, and Zooni grieved the loss of a dear friend and a confidant who supported her at each and every step.
The NIA arrest Yakush Sheikh, who taunts the India Government that he is untouchable. Zooni threatens to kill him and finds that the plan was executed by Zakit Naikoo. The RDX came from the Kathua tunnel. Adil was specifically identified and freed from prison for this mission.
Khawar didn't know that something was going to happen, and Zakir Naikoo took complete advantage of the situation. Zooni got very angry at Khawar, and she suspended him as she was done dealing with him and she didn't want him to come in between of her operations any longer.The basic problem with the abrogation of Article 370 was that it could only be changed by the J&K constituent assembly that was dissolved in 1957. So basically, in the absence of such an assembly, nothing could be done by the parliament.
But Rajeshwari's team found a loophole in the law, and they got to know that sub clause D was hidden from everybody. The suspicion arose when Rajeshwari's legal team found out that the article had been amended even after the constituent assembly was dissolved.
In Article 367 of the Indian Constitution, it was mentioned that the president had the power to interpret any given article, and so at that time, the powers of the constituent assembly were vested in the state legislative assembly.
Using its powers, the legislative assembly made some changes, and then clause D was hidden from the public eye so that everybody believed that 370 couldn't be repealed. Zooni and her colleague, Wasim found the original document in the J&K secretariat library, and they sent it to the PMO.
Zooni and Wasim were attacked on their way, but they were able to make a near escape. The foundation was set, and now the PM (Arun Govil) had to just make sure that the bill to abolish Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which gave special status to the states of Jammu and Kashmir, was passed by both houses of parliament.Zooni was in charge of any and all security threats coming from the PM's actions on 5th and 6th Aug 2019. She creates a detailed assessment of all external and internal security threats facing the country.
Khawar is angry with Zooni and passes the information he has to ISI and they understand that India is planning something big on 5th Aug (including an invasion of Pakistan). All separatist leaders and political leaders are jailed or kept in house arrest closer to the date.
Brinda knew that the center was going to abrogate 370. She was about to go live on air, but the PMO puts out a plethora of conflicting reports ranging from Indus Water Treaty to hanging to Yakub Sheikh. This puts enough doubt in Brinda that she cancels her program.
The PM himself sends his convoy ahead without him, to distract the press and goes alone in his car to the President to get the bill signed. ISI realizes that Khawar gave them false info, and they activate Naikoo.Zakir Naikoo's plan was that he would first give the impression that he and his organization were going to kill the governor of J&K, but in reality, they were going after Jalal, the ex-CM. He wanted to do that so that he could pin the blame for Jalal's death on the central government and then drag the Human Rights Commission into the debate and give an open way to foreign countries like the US to intervene.
Zooni and her team were unaware of it, but when they were heading towards the governor's house, the former realized that something was not right. Very intuitively, she asked her team to go to Jalal's house and ensure his safety. It was a huge gamble that she played, and she knew what the consequences could be.
Meanwhile, the home minister went to Rajya Sabha (Kiran Karmarkar) to get the bill passed, and there was a specific reason why he went to the lower house first when, in fact, in Lok Sabha, he could have easily gotten it passed as he had a majority of seats in his favor. The central government didn't want to give the opposition a chance to prepare, and that's why, in a shocking move, the home minister first went to the Rajya Sabha.Zooni killed Naikoo, and the bill was passed in the lower house of parliament. Ultimately, on August 5, 2019, the article that gave special status to J&K was removed. Peace returned in the valley, and the cases of violence dropped remarkably.
It was a huge victory for the central government, as they had delivered on their promise.",158.0

As a former investigative journalist, Rahul's internal conflicts mirror the timeless struggle between right and wrong, ambition and greed and love versus selfish desires.
Rahul, propelled by unwavering ambition, finds himself ensnared in the corporate web, where the line between ethical pursuits and the seductive allure of greed blurs. His formidable boss, Veer, becomes the embodiment of the ethical dilemmas Rahul grapples with, in his quest for success.
Amid the chaos of conflicting emotions, Rahul inspired by Buddha's philosophies, takes a daring leap, forsaking the comfort of his former life to chase a dream. However, this journey is marred by an internal struggle that pits ambitions against the unwavering principles he once held dear, leaving him in the clutches of a writer's block that mirrors the impasse within his moral compass.At this time, Rahul's once-heartbroken girlfriend, Tina returns to him. As they navigate the revival of their relationship, Rahul confronts the challenge of harmonizing genuine affection with the shadow of his own desires that threaten to eclipse it.Tina re-enters Rahul's life not just as a love interest but as a guiding force attempting to navigate the complexities of his internal battle. Tina urges Rahul to step out of his cocoon and find stories. Nothing excites him until he meets a Stranger who intrigues him and takes him through a mental ride unveiling a forgotten, suppressed memory.Rahul's formidable intelligence becomes a double-edged sword as Stranger puts him at the crossroads of a life-altering decision. In a pivotal moment, as the threads of Rahul's narrative threaten to unravel, unexpected revelations force him to confront the consequences of his choices.The film, a poignant exploration of the human soul, debates fervently about the role of money in the lives of ethical dreamers. As Rahul confronts the harsh realities of a world driven by financial success, the narrative becomes a compelling discourse on the intersection of dreams, ethics, and the unrelenting pursuit of success.
As the film hurtles towards its climax, the audience is left with lingering reflections on the profound choices we make, the internal battles that shape our destinies, and the timeless conflict between the pursuit of dreams and the preservation of love.",100.0
